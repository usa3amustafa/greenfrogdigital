                  What does going virtual mean?
                </h3>
                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Going virtual means a business runs remotely, through a
                  virtual office where a business and it's employees are enabled
                  to work remotely, offering goods and services to customers
                  that are accessbile through the internet. Business owners and
                  employees may also work from home, in different cities or in
                  different countries, where they manage, co-ordinate and
                  deliver services by means of technology.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Why go virtual?</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  There are many reasons to consider going virtual, I've listed
                  the top three reasons that have a direct impact on your bottom
                  line and productivity.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">1. Save on overheads</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Of course a virtual office depends on your type of business
                  but back office and support functions can easily be managed
                  remotely. Virtual offices do not incur the costs of leasing or
                  buying a building, associated maintenance costs as well as
                  providing furniture, office equipment and cleaning costs.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">2. Increase productivity</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The second reason is that by avoiding time spent commuting,
                  you significantly increase your teams productivity. If you
                  value your time and those of others, the last thing you want
                  to be doing is wasting time commuting, and, if you have a
                  family, the stress related to juggling commuting, work and
                  family obligations, can have a negative impact not only
                  productivity levels, but on the personal lives of you and your
                  team. There are phenomenal tools that monitor productivity and
                  output and still allow for team engagement and support.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  3. Expand your business and increase your profits
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Think about where you will get the best return for your money.
                  Is having at team that you see everyday and provide an office
                  space with everything that comes with that, worth more than
                  what you could be spending your money on - like marketing
                  initiatives and growing your business?
                  <br />
                  Really think about that. Because all these costs that we incur
                  for things that we think we need to have a business, actually
                  just eats away at our profits and really could be spent on
                  expanding our business.
                </p>

                  We've been conditioned as a society about what success is and
                  how hard we have to work to have it. We've been told how you
                  have to get an education, to get a job, to be told what to do
                  and then your success depends on how well you do, according to
                  the people who tell you what to do.

                  While many may still be stuck in this mindset, the workforce
                  is changing and the reality is that people crave autonomy.
                  People want to do work that gives them a sense of purpose and
                  where they feel they have control over their lives.

                  In breeding a company culture that truly wants the best people
                  and who aligns with a remote office environment, the key
                  things you need to be successful in adopting this approach is:

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>Hire people who value their time.</b>These people are
                  spending their time on high-value life time activities -
                  either making money or doing the things they love - including
                  the work they love. In working with clients in my coaching
                  practice, the talent and skills you want aren't wasting their
                  time on things that they are not aligned to, they're focused
                  and goal orientated. These are the people you want to hire.

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>Set a clear mandate with clear deadlines.</b> Avoid
                  frustration by removing gray areas with clear mandates of what
                  needs to be done with clear expectations and deadlines. Be on
                  the same page and document it so that it's easy to remain
                  focused as well as address any issues that arise.

                  <b>Make sure they have the tools to get the job done.</b>The
                  people you actually need and want aren't going to work for you
                  if don't give them what they need to get the job done. It's
                  worth having a list of tools and how to access them on a
                  centralised platform. Use a project management tool to
                  communicate, share links, stay on top of deadlines and keep
                  everybody in the loop. Do make yourself accessible so that you
                  can address any issues that arise.

                  Save money and hire a virtual assistant. In the
                  4-Hour-Work-Week, Tim Ferris advocates using virtual
                  assistants. I couldn't agree more. Hire permanently for those
                  critical roles if you must but hire as you need for the
                  others. Consider a virtual assistant for administration
                  functions that can be done at a specific time of the month,
                  for projects and specific skills that you may need on a
                  demand-basis.

                  Apart from been able to significantly scale your business by
                  going virtual, one of the clear benefits you have is the
                  freedom to work from where ever you are. You can travel and
