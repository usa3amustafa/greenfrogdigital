                  You can display up to 70 characters in your page title so
                  don’t keep it too short (or too long) – take advantage of
                  using keyword phrases in your page titles.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You don’t have to include your company or website name in a
                  page title and if you do, position it at the end of the page
                  title and use your keyword phrase in the beginning of a title.
                  It’s easier to read and will capture more attention than your
                  company name would if you place your keyword phrase at the end
                  of the page title.

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Users want information quickly and therefore you want to make

                  and H6 tags. Include your keyword phrases and variants of your

                  Internal linking means linking to other pages within your

                  shows Google what and how your content is related, and the
                  value of that content. Because Google deems a page that gets a
                  lot of valuable links as more important, you’ll increase the
                  chance of that page ranking.

                  External links are links that link to other websites, either
                  other websites linking to your website, or you linking your
                  website to others. When you create content and link to other
                  reputable sources outside of your website, you show search
                  engines that you've done your research, thereby giving your
                  website more authority and making it more trustworthy.

                  You want to have your links open in new tabs so that when
                  someone clicks one of your external links, your page stays
                  open. This means that your page stays open while they look at
                  another page with a higher chance of them returning to it.

                  the page. Use your keywords, phrases and variants to name and
                  describe your images and videos in the following places:
