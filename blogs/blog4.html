                  Affiliate marketing is the process of earning a commission by
                  promoting other people’s or company’s products. You find a
                  product you like, promote it to others through a number of
                  marketing initiatives and then earn a piece of the profit for
                  each sale that you make.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  It’s based on revenue sharing. If you have a product and want
                  to sell more, you can offer promoters a financial incentive
                  through an affiliate program to sell your product. If you
                  don't have a product and want to make money, you can promote a
                  product that you feel has value and earn an income from it as
                  an affiliate marketer.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The beauty of affiliate marketing is that once you join an
                  affiliate program, the merchant or network provides you with
                  all the marketing material - such as banners and links that
                  you simply just include on your site or promote through your
                  marketing strategy of choice. Some even give you copy and
                  other useful material like podcasts and trainings. All you
                  need to do is focus on your marketing strategy and driving
                  traffic to their offering via your website, blog or email
                  marketing campaign.

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Why do affiliate marketing?</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Affiliate marketing is the corner stone of my business. Why?
                  As an entrepreneur, I had to learn very quickly that I can't
                  do it all, be it all, create it all and then go and gain all
                  the experience to get the credibility to get people to buy
                  from me. I had to get smart about where I spend my time, and
                  that was to focus on what I'm good at. Then leverage tools and
                  other peoples' knowledge to help me get to where I want to be.
                  Why try and reinvent something that has already been designed,
                  tested, results proven and packaged - think about how much
                  time, energy, money and, most importantly - EXPERIENCE - it
                  takes to offer a product that promises results?
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  There are people who've been there, "done it" and have turned
                  what they know into quality products that offer value, empower
                  people and make life easier. This is why the knowledge
                  business is booming - we want to learn from experience, not
                  text books. We don't want theory, we want to learn from real
                  people who we can relate to, who've been through the trenches,
                  who can lessen our learning curve in achieving what we want by
                  showing us what worked and what didn't, what to look out for
                  and what to avoid in getting the results and things that we
                  want faster.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  How does affiliate marketing work?
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  There are four parties involved in the affiliate marketing
                  process:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The <b>Merchant</b>: This is the party that creates the
                  product, also known as the creator, the seller, the brand, the
                  retailer, or the vendor.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The <b>Publisher</b>: The affiliate who advertises and markets
                  the merchant's product in return for a commission based on
                  sales or leads.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The <b>Consumer</b>: The customer or consumer who buys the
                  merchants product from the publisher / affiliate.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The <b>Network</b>: The network acts as an intermediary
                  between the affiliate and the merchant where they handle the
                  payment and product delivery process. Network directories
                  manage a number of affiliate programs.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Not all affiliate programs are facilitated by an affiliate
                  network and many businesses have a direct affiliate program.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Cookies are used to help the website keep track of visitor
                  clicks linked to affiliate offers and sales over the cookie

                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  How do you do affiliate marketing?
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You can start promoting affiliate products in your blog, on
                  your website or you can create a niche website where you
                  promote products and/or services by category.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  By creating content in the form of tutorials, review posts,
                  resource pages or through email marketing, you include your
                  affiliate link and/or banners that have been supplied by the
                  Merchant or Network provider.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You then want to optimize your web pages and track your
                  rankings in Google so that Google starts sending traffic your
                  way.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Where to find affiliate products?</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The best way to find suitable affiliate products to promote is
                  through an affiliate program directory, which is essentially a
                  database of different affiliate programs online. This way you
                  can find the right program, understand all the details about
                  and how the program works and then sign up to join the
                  program. Here's a couple of directories to get you started:

                  <span class="bold underline">A tip</span>:- Most affiliate
                  programs have an application process so make sure you read
                  their terms and conditions before you apply to ensure that you
                  have everything they require in place. Some are particularly
                  strict and you want to know what their expectations are and
                  any advertising and promoting limitations.
