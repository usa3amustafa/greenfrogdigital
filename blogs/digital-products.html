                <h3 class="blog-headline">What are digital products?</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Digital products include e-books, guides, online courses,
                  audio products, downloadable templates and software - to name
                  just a few, and are increasingly attractive because of their
                  low creation costs with your primary investment being your
                  time and expertise in creating products that can be scaled.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  By now, you've probably seen how many entrepreneurs are
                  creating extremely profitable businesses for themselves
                  through a foundation of high-margin digital products.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Whatever your skill set, you need to think of ways you can
                  package your services and what you know into digital products
                  that you can leverage in obtaining more leads and sales for
                  your business as well as create alternative income channels
                  for your online business.
                </p>

                  customers with FREE high value easy-to-consume digital
                  products
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Whether it be through your blog or “opt-in give-aways”, this
                  is your ultimate marketing tool in helping your website sell
                  more. In Secrets of Website Conversions Revealed, people don’t
                  care about you or your business, other than what’s in it for
                  them. The more value you can give them, the more likely
                  they’ll buy from you without you having to do a sales-pitch.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The premise is that by giving away free high-value content,
                  you build credibility and trust in the products you charge
                  for. View it as a taster of what you charge for but think
                  high-value, easy to consume, easy to implement and results
                  orientated. This is what people want - instant gratification -
                  they don't want long, laborious, energy consuming processes
                  and sales pitches that are going to require effort in getting
                  what they want. This is a powerful marketing strategy to
                  implement.

                  Create alternative revenue streams by creating digital
                  products

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  According to
                  <a
                    href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/261676/digital-buyer-penetration-worldwide/"

                    >Statista.com</a
                  >: "With digital buyer penetration expected to surpass 65
                  percent of internet users worldwide in 2021, the e-commerce
                  industry is set to evolve and expand."

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Turn what you know into digital products. Writing, video and
                  audio are the way to go. Whether it's an e-book, video course
                  or audio series, you can digitize (and monetize) what you know
                  and offer your audience options. In my resourcing business I
                  have a number of free guides on interview coaching, I
                  converted my interview coaching program into an e-book and
                  then offer one-on-one coaching - this way, there are three
                  options available to anyone looking for interview coaching,
                  each with different premiums and value, depending on what
                  they're after and what they can afford.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  So, think about what your
                  <a href="#" class="read-more">Perfect Client</a> would want or
                  need right now - what is a pain point that you can solve
                  immediately, and turn that into a digital product in a format
                  that is easy for them to consume? Give them a taster by means
                  of a lead magnet and then promote your offer by taking them
                  through a conversion journey that leads to a sale promotion of
                  your product.

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Leverage the expertise of others</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The beauty of selling digital products on your site is that
                  you don't even have to create them yourself. You can promote
                  products of other people and organisations who complement your
                  product or service offering. This is why
                  <a href="./blog4.html" class="read-more"
                    >affiliate-marketing</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a href="./blog3.html" class="read-more">email marketing</a>,
                  when done correctly, are so successful.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Giving your website traffic access to high-value products that
                  have already been designed, tested, result proven,
                  pre-packaged and that solves a need, means that you don't need
                  to spend your precious resources in reinventing products that
                  are already available.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  There are zero costs associated with becoming an affiliate and
                  by offering high-value products to your audience, you build
                  more credibility.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The real opportunity that digital products offer, because you
                  don't have to recreate products, is that you create more time
                  to do the other important things you need to get to. Once
                  you've automated your sales process, and learnt how to market
                  your digital products, you have the freedom to choose what you
                  do with your time - and that my friends, is <em>freedom</em>!
