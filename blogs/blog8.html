                  It takes a certain mindset and discipline if we want to
                  achieve the happiness and success we want in our lives. We
                  have to become aware and vigilant with how we approach life,
                  and business, and realize the power of our attitudes and
                  choices that shape our reality. Our mindset determines how we
                  direct our mental, emotional and physical energy in everyday
                  living and deal with what life throws at us.

                  While there are many success mindsets to master, having worked
                  with clients in my Results Coaching program and my personal

                  entrepreneurial success:
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">1. The power of anticipation.</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Creating any kind of change in life, whether it’s starting a
                  business, changing vocation, embarking a new life path or
                  doing anything you haven’t done before, you have to anticipate
                  how you’re going to do it so that you can plan for it to be
                  successful.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  When you lack planning and don’t have a frame of reference for
                  what you’re going to experience, it seems foreign and it may
                  cause confusion and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  When you lack planning and don’t have a frame of reference for
                  what you’re going to experience, it seems foreign and it may
                  cause confusion and anxiety.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  It generally starts with an idea, then a concept, then a
                  vision, and then you start taking action and things start to
                  happen. And in that process, you have to set yourself up to
                  deal with the emotional, physical and mental changes that may
                  or may not occur.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  In anticipating change, you need to get real about how that
                  change is going to affect everything in your life – your
                  money, your energy, your health, your time, your resources and
                  the people you care about. With foresight you can then plan on
                  how you are going to deal with each aspect, anticipate what
                  kind of challenges you’ll encounter and have solutions in
                  place that will support you in getting to where you want to
                  be.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  In making ourselves successful, we often have to first make
                  space for what we want to come in, which means some things (in
                  some cases, a lot) need to go – this may include people,
                  situations, habits and belief patterns that hold us back and
                  it can be very challenging letting go of what is familiar but
                  that we know we can’t take with us.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Through the power of anticipation, you not only anticipate and
                  prepare for what’s ahead, but when things come up while you’re
                  going through it, you’ve already equipped yourself with
                  strategies and coping mechanisms to get through it.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  2. Be hungry for your own progress.
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Without the hunger and desire to go after what you want,
                  you’re not really going to get anywhere. This is what is going
                  to fuel you, move you forward and get you through the
                  challenges you’re going to encounter while you’re making
                  things happen.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  It’s going to take maintenance, sustenance, endurance and
                  strength, and you’ve got to be committed to doing better than
                  you did yesterday and to prepare yourself for whatever that
                  means because there will be some challenging situations and
                  decisions that are going to come up on your entrepreneurial
                  journey. Your self-motivation is going to come from how strong
                  your desire is to have what you want.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">3. The power of association.</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You are the average of the five people you hang around. You
                  really want to be around people who motivate you to be the
                  best you can be, who support you, who you can confide in,
                  people who are smarter than you, people who are more talented
                  than you, who are more creative and ambitious than you –
                  people you can learn from and help you grow. You want to be
                  around people who elevate each other, feel joyful, are
                  energized and are authentic.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  When we’re with people who are not aligned to our success, we
                  stay stuck, we doubt ourselves, we tend to not make the best
                  decisions, we keep ourselves small and we consume a lot of
                  energy in trying to maintain those relationships – energy that
                  could be spent on expanding our business, doing the things we
                  love and spending it with the people who actually make us feel
                  good.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The reality is that we often just outgrow relationships and
                  while letting go of these relationships can be painful at
                  times, you have to look at it from a different perspective.
                  It’s not personal, it’s called growing (up). Some peoples’
                  journey will align with yours as you move forward and others
                  not, and that’s ok.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Association is powerful, because it incorporates everything
                  you’re associated to. What you listen to, what you watch, what
                  you read, what your share on social media. Do a quick audit in
                  these areas and assess if you’re surrounding, listening,
                  watching and sharing information that actually brings value
                  into your life and those of others, elevates your personal
                  brand and helps you get closer to what you want to achieve in
                  life.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  If you don’t have access to the people you really want to
                  associate with, start by reading books, blogs and podcasts of
                  people who are achieving success already. My personal favorite
                  is listening to podcasts. I love that you can listen to them
                  at anytime, anywhere and you can choose what you want to
                  listen to. They’re the perfect traffic buster and have become
                  a habit that I’ve incorporated to keep me motivated and
                  inspired.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  I listen to podcasts of people who are successful based on my
                  own definition of success, who are on the same journey as I
                  am, who share their experiences, what they have learnt, what
                  tools they use and give insights into how they have achieved
                  success in other areas of their lives. My favorite podcasts
                  are The Tim Ferris Show, Amy Porterfield, The Lead Generation
                  and the Mastin Kipp Podcast. There are so many amazing
                  entrepreneurs sharing their stories and skills to help other
                  entrepreneurs, it would be worth your while to spend some time
                  in finding those that resonate with you and learn all you can
                  from them to accelerate your success.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">4. Develop a growth mindset.</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Having a growth mindset is the belief that you are in control
                  of your own ability, that you can learn and improve yourself
                  to be successful.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  In order to develop a growth mindset, you must be prepared to
                  learn - learn about yourself, learn from your failures, learn
                  from success, learn about your customers, learn about people,
                  learn technology, learn tools, learn new ways of doing,
                  thinking and being. You can’t really move forward if you’re
                  wanting to hang onto the old way doing things.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  A way of developing a strong growth mindset is to view the
                  challenges you're encountering from a learning perspective as
                  opposed to feeling like a victim or not having any options
                  available to you. This means approaching challenging
                  situations with the question "What is this teaching me?". This
                  question is really powerful because it removes the blaming and
                  shaming of the situation, and empowers you to look at the
                  situation more objectively, which in turn, helps you to think
                  more clearly in coming up with solutions. By taking this
                  approach, you give yourself permission to be OK with learning
                  as you grow and eliminate the unnecessary pressure of having
                  to have the answers all of the time.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Another way to develop a growth mindset is to work with a
                  coach who has expertise in a specific area that you may need
                  help with. I’ve personally worked with a money coach, a
                  business coach and a life coach over the last five years
                  because I just didn’t have all the skills myself and I didn’t
                  know people who could help me get to where I wanted to be. All
                  of the coaches I’ve worked with advocate self-investment which
                  means that you actually need to invest in yourself to make
                  yourself better – in business and personally.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Working with someone who you resonate with and who’s already
                  achieved the success you want is gold and worth every cent if
                  are willing to learn and apply their teachings. You
                  automatically expand your perception of what is available to
                  you and you’ll naturally start attracting like-minded people
                  that will introduce you to other people, who not only
                  introduce you to tools and resources that help you get to
                  where you want to be but open you up to other opportunities.
                  When you’re open to learning, you increase your potential and
                  the possibilities to expand.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">5. Habit is destiny.</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You have to take daily, consistent and intentional action
                  towards what you want to achieve in life and in business. You
                  have to do it habitually until it becomes automatic.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  We are creatures of habit. We already have routines that we
                  execute without even thinking about it and where we want to
                  create change in our lives, we need to accept that it's going
                  to take some effort in creating success focused habits.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The good news is that it only takes 30 days to implement a new
                  habit and while the initial stages are met with resistance,
                  once you get into flow with it, do it enough, think and feel
                  it enough, it becomes involuntary. This means that you can
                  create new habits that are in alignment with what you want to
                  achieve - forming new routines, reprogramming how you work and
                  what you spend your energy on so that you drive your own
                  success.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Ideally you want to have a morning success ritual that sets
                  you up for the day. You want to feel emotionally, mentally and
                  physically strong and you want to set yourself up for maximum
                  productivity so that you get the most results out of your day.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Another important habit to create is quality rejuvenation - to
                  rest, recharge and refuel. To give yourself time to replenish
                  improves your energy, clarity and drive.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  6. Time management vs self management.
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Unfortunately, we can’t manage time and we can’t control it.
                  We have to learn to manage ourselves. By managing ourselves,
                  we take self-responsibility and we avoid projecting our
                  inability to manage ourselves when we focus on not having
                  enough time.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  This is why creating success focused habits is essential to us
                  achieving our desires and personal success. When we think
                  about how available and accessible we are to other people, how
                  we indulge in low grade entertainment such as sensory
                  stimulation, idle gossip, guilty pleasures and TV, and we use
                  our time to start enjoying the activities that, directly or
                  indirectly bring us more results, we’ll manage our time better
                  and achieve more.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  I like to focus on high-value lifetime activities, where I'm
                  either working on my business and marketing initiatives, or
                  spending time on the things that feed my soul, keep me
                  connected to the activities and people I love and fuel my cups
                  mentally, emotionally and physically. The reality is that if
                  you’re spending energy on things that don’t align with your
                  high-value lifetime activities, then you’re really just
                  wasting your time and your energy, and who's got time for
                  that?

                  7. There is no magic pill for sustainable long-term results.
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  We live in a culture of instant gratification. Everybody wants
                  a quick fix and while there are many promises made out there,
                  for the important things in life – like relationships, health
                  and money, there aren’t many and we have put in the work to
                  get the sustainable and long term results that we want.

                  It’s a continuous process that requires continuous attention
                  and energy. Your results are going to be dependent on how
                  badly you want it and what you’re prepared to do to obtain it.
                  To master yourself and achieve what you want in life and in
                  business, is going to take doing the work.

                  8. Productivity is the antidote to fear.
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Fear only turns into worry, which leads to more fear and
                  worry, and worry is really a waste of time. It keeps us stuck
                  and indecisive. The best way to eliminate fear is to be as
                  productive as you can be.

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  By being more productive you will feel more in control of
                  where you are going and how you are going to get there, fear
                  less and be more inspired. It's also the most constructive way
                  to face your fears and help you stay focused while you’re in
                  the trenches going through it.

                  I like to list the key goals of my businesses in detail and
                  break them into bite-size activities so that when I am
                  struggling to focus in moments of fear and uncertainty, I can
                  focus on getting things done on that list without having to
                  really think about it. I have a tool that I can easily access
                  to help me refocus my attention instead of getting caught up
                  in the paralysis of fear which causes unnecessary delays and
                  consumes an immense amount of mental and emotional energy that
                  could be spent on getting things done.

                  The truth is, we have to become self -aware, self-driven and
                  self-disciplined if we're going to rely on ourselves to create
                  the success we want in our lives. The mind is powerful - how
                  we think and use our energy will determine our results.
