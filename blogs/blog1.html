                  Your website is more than just a website.
                </h3>
                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Your online presence is where conversion happens. Your website
                  is your 24/7 marketing and sales force, representing your
                  brand, presenting your offer and should be transforming your
                  traffic into leads and sales. When you align your digital
                  strategy to your marketing strategy, you significantly grow
                  your online business.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Whether you’re building your first website or optimizing a
                  current one, there comes a time for every entrepreneur to
                  revisit what makes an outstanding business website that
                  converts clicks into sales.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  After all, you need your website to do it all: represent your
                  business, capture leads, close sales, climb to the top of
                  search engine results, and connect to all your other digital
                  platforms seamlessly. And you—you have to do it all too:
                  choose your content, write and design your pages, connect your
                  marketing tools, test it out, and not spend thousands of
                  dollars or hours getting from A to B to blastoff.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  What you really want your website to do is take your audience
                  through a journey on your website that will result in a
                  conversion - ultimately a lead or a sale. You want to attract
                  buyers and not just traffic - because traffic without sales
                  means nothing, in fact, you'll be losing money.

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Know your audience</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  This is key in converting your website traffic. Profile your
                  Perfect Client Persona to get really specific about who your
                  audience is so that you can create a website that provides
                  content that your Client Pesona can relate to, solves their
                  problems and helps you create products and services that they
                  want and not what you know most about.

                  Get clear on your business goals and align your website goals

                  Invest some time in getting clear on your business goals so
                  that you can align our website goals and digital strategy

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Set a clear page hierarchy</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  After you have developed the overall website goals and your
                  digital strategy, the next step is making it easy for website
                  visitors to find content. To do this, make sure your page
                  hierarchy is clear. Bucket your content by theme and
                  importance. Try physically drawing a plan as you create a
                  high-level outline. Most people freeze up at this point so
                  it’s important to visualize your website structure. Think
                  conversion and not just information - what do they need to see
                  in order for them to make a purchase?
                </p>

                  Revealed for more tips on critical website pages and what
                  information drives conversions.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">Keep it simple</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Website functionality is defined by the ease with which a
                  viewer can navigate your site and obtain the information they
                  are seeking. You want to make navigation simple. Simple design
                  and text are essential to an effective business website. An
                  overly complicated website with cluttered visuals and text
                  doesn’t convert and too many page elements lead to website
                  visitor confusion. Think user-experience and be pragmatic in
                  your approach.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">
                  Maintain well-defined Call-to-Actions
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Clearly state what you want people to do.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Use phrases like, <em>“Subscribe to our newsletter,”</em>
                  <em>“Book your reservation now”</em> or
                  <em>“Email us for a free quote today.”</em> After you identify
                  your page structure, sketch out your content sections and
                  maintain well-defined CTAs, then layer in conversion
                  opportunities like pop-ups and alert bars.
                </p>

                  Some interesting stastics on mobile commerce to consider,

                <p class="blog-desc italic">
                  By 2020, mobile commerce will account for 45 percent of all
                  e-commerce activities globally and mobile e-commerce will be
                  responsible for $2.32 trillion — or about 67.2 percent — of
                  e-commerce sales by 2021.

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The bottom line is that not only do you need to get online but
                  your website has to be mobile responsive. Before publishing
                  anything on the web, always consider desktop and mobile
                  devices. Having a site that isn’t mobile optimized can drive
                  away customers, hurt your SEO and simply looks unprofessional.
