                <h3 class="blog-headline italic">What is an email list?</h3>
                <p class="blog-desc">
                  While this may seem like a no-brainer, let's get clear on the
                  definition.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  An email list is a database of email subscribers who have
                  opted-in to receive promotional messages from your company.
                  It's a process of exchange - in return for obtaining an email
                  address, you provide relevant and valuable information to your
                  subscriber. These are not just followers who follow you
                  because they like you. What many people fail to realise is, is
                  that an email list is gold because these are people who
                  actually want to hear from you and you can nurture and grow an
                  email list into happy paying customers.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  People are careful with their personal information and if you
                  consider how many websites, services and product choice there
                  is out there, when somebody subscribes to hear from you, know
                  that they actually want to hear from you and you have an
                  obligation - if you want to turn your email list into an asset
                  - to nurture and build a relationship with them.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline">How to build an email list</h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  The easiest way to build an email list is to give away 'FREE'
                  high-value information.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Now giving away free high-value information does have a
                  benefit – you always only give away high-value information -
                  by means of a lead magnet, which is a digital product that is
                  valuable, easy to consume, easy to implement and gives a
                  result, in exchange for two things: money or personal
                  information. With email list building, we’re focusing on
                  information.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Lead magnets are displayed as a number of to Call-to-Action
                  buttons on your website that prompt the user to take action.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  You can also ask your audience to subscribe but you need to
                  tell them what they're subscribing to, what they will receive
                  and how often they will receive it - and then deliver on what
                  you promise.
                </p>

                  Developing an email marketing strategy
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Email marketing is a powerful way to grow your business. With
                  your email list being your biggest asset, you need to have an
                  email management tool that helps you use that list to grow
                  your business through attractive forms, trackable data, and
                  simple but powerful automations. It is your direct line to
                  your customer – there is nothing between you and they have
                  opted-in to your subscriber list because they want to hear
                  from you.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  If you're looking to promote a product or offer, consider
                  taking your subscriber through a conversion journey instead of
                  just hitting with them an offer. This is where you automate a
                  series of emails where you share valuable information such as
                  your best blog posts, trainings, videos, webinars or your best
                  resources that solidify your expertise and credibility before
                  presenting your offer. This way your audience will be prepared
                  for the next time you decide to launch a new product or
                  service. If you only send promotional emails, you may turn off
                  your subscribers since you haven’t taken the time to nurture
                  the relationship.
                </p>

                <h3 class="blog-headline italic">
                  Top tips for email marketing:
                </h3>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>Automation is vital.</b> The last thing you want to be
                  doing is sending emails manually to every subscriber. This
                  means you have to check your email every day and then keep
                  track of which subscriber is in what stage of the conversion
                  journey. Trust me – this is nothing short of a nightmare to
                  manage. Automate your emails so that you spend your time on
                  marketing initiatives.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>Consistency is key.</b>
                  Don’t over promise and under deliver. Do what you say you’re
                  going to do, when you said you’ll do it.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>Always lead with value.</b>
                  Your subscribers want to feel respected, heard, and understood
                  in the process and this is the best way to build a
                  relationship with them.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  <b>DO NOT flood anybody's inboxes,</b>
                  especially not with just sales offerings. Once you’ve lost a
                  subscriber, it’s very difficult to get them back and you risk
                  your brand reputation.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  Another interesting fact to consider is that while social
                  media is on the rise, email marketing far outweighs social
                  media in generating leads, driving sales and increasing
                  customer retention.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-desc">
                  What you want to do is use social media to drive visitors to
                  your website, where you use lead magnets to convert those
                  visitors into subscribers. Invest in an
                  <a
                    href="https://mailchimp.com/"
                    target="_blank"

                  to help you build relationships with your subscribers through
                  your email marketing strategy.
